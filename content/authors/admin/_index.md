Dr. Chelsea Peters joined Roanoke College in 2020. As a hydrologist,
Dr. Petersâ€™ interests broadly revolve around water
resources, human adaptation, and climate change. She
received her Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, and
has since been researching and teaching at the
University of Delaware. She uses a variety of
field techniques, modeling approaches, and
quantitative and qualitative datasets to address
the challenges of sustainable water
management. Previously, her work was based
in Bangladesh where she worked to unravel the
dynamic water system of the climatevulnerable coastal region. More recently, her
research aims to characterize the salinization of
coastal water resources in the Mid-Atlantic using hydrogeologic modeling,
economic experiments, and stakeholder decision-making. Peters is a certified
Project Management Professional and an active volunteer for international
water development projects. Her work always incorporates aspects of
knowledge transfer, partner engagement, and science communication.
